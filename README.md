# PyBer_Analysis
Background
The purpose of this assignment was to assist Omar create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type with the information given by V. Isualize. Using Pandas and Matplotlib, we created a multi-line graph to show the total weekly fares for each city type. 

Using Pandas groupby function with the count and sum methods of PyBer DataFrame columns, I got the total number of rides, total number of drivers, and the total fares for each city type. Then, I calculated the average fare per ride and average fare per driver for each city type. Finally, I added the data to the new DataFrame, then formatted the columns. 

Results: 

The results of this analysis were that the Urban city type pays significantly more in fares then the Rural city type. From January to April the Urban fares were anywhere from $1600 to $2500. The Suburban city type was anywhere from $750 to $1475. While the Rural city type was almost not used at some point but were up to $500 in April. This can prove that the denser areas use ride sharing more often.

Summary: 

This can conclude that the Urban cities are more likely to utilize PyBer Ride share services. It is easier for people to use ride share in Urban areas because they do not have to worry about finding parking. Rural areas, more people are going to drive themselves. It is also likely that there are more places to go to in the Urban areas verse the Rural areas. With a denser community and more options for leaving the house, people are going to visit that area more often. 
Recommendation 1: PyBer should schedule more drivers in the Urban areas that can travel to the Rural areas as needed to ensure that the service demands can be always met. 
Recommendation 2: Services were almost not existent for the winter month January. This means that scheduling a driver in this area will not result in a positive sale for that month. PyBer could keep someone on-call for this time, but should not 
Recommendation 3: There were more drivers in the Urban areas then there were rides for this time period. Having too many drivers in areas that are not being used can cause overhead waste. This can be avoided by placing more or less drivers in certain areas at times of high or low demand.
